== Project: ContactHub
ContactHub is a desktop address book application designed for NUS students, created as part of NUS modules CS2101 and CS2103T.
The project constraints were to create an addressbook application where input was handled by a  CLI, while output was handled by a GUI.

The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 6 kLoC.

=== Enhancement Added: NUSMods Implementation

==== External behavior

#End of Extract#

==== Justification

The enhancement allows students, our target audience, to conveniently check
useful information within the application using only the CLI. NUSMods was chosen as it is popular among NUS students
and provides up-to-date information.

Checking module and venue information are the most relevant features a student would use
on a regular basis, within the constraints of the project.
