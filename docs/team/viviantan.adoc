=== Enhancement Added: Keyboard Shortcuts

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=keyboardshortcuts]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

When using ContactHub, it is sometimes quite a hassle when using the command line. Especially when adding
numerous contacts or when typing incorrect information. Hence, with keyboard shortcuts, using the command line
would be much more easier and time saving. This would benefit the user greatly as well as attract more users to
use ContactHub.
